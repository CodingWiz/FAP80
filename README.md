#FAP80, A Z80 retro computer for the future

FAP80 is a Z80 retro computer with modern twists to make the experience of designing, programming, and debugging this computer as painless and straightforward as possible.

FAP80 uses an active backplane design with 5 slots, and a number of cards can be plugged into the backplane for it to function.

## Technical Highlights

### Active Backplane
FAP80 has an active backplane managed by a STM32 microcontroller. Since it can take over the bus and write into EEPROM directly, there is no need to take off the EEPROM to burn programs, or have a EEPROM programmer at all.
