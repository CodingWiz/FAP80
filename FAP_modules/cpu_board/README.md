The CPU board of FAP80, to be plugged in the backplane.

## Overview

This board is rather simple and straightforward. It breaks out all Z80 signals onto the bus. It also buffers all address lines, data lines, and control output signals while converting all 5V signals to 3.3V, so the entire bus runs at 3.3V.

I recommend using CMOS versions of the Z80 CPU, as it uses less power and runs cooler.
