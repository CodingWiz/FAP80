Currently there are two ways to program FAP80. One is do it directly in Z80 assembly, cross assemble it using zmacs and then upload it into FAP. Examples and details are in [zmacs folder](./zmacs).

The other way is program in C, then compile it to assembly, then cross assemble and upload. Being able to use C makes it much simpler to program, however the result might be slower than pure assembly, and it's not as easy to debug. Examples and details are in [sdcc folder](./sdcc)
