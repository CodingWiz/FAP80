A simple Twitch IRC client. An ESP8266 running nodeMCU provides the FAP80 with chat messages, FAP80 displays them and send keyboard inputs back to the ESP8266. In this sense FAP80 acts like a terminal display.

I'll add more infomation in the coming days, but meanwhile feel free to take a look at the code.
